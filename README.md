# FtD-APS-Tetris
Collection of community discovered optimal APS tetris layouts for round turrets using 3 clip (T) loaders, intended to be used as prefabs.  
Nontrvial layouts were found computationally and are guaranteed to be the highest possible density (if not the most symmetric)  

- [1m](/1m) contains a set of 5x5 to 23x23 unarmoured layout prefabs
- [1m Front Armour](/1m%20Front%20Armour) contains a set of 7x7 to 15x15 frontally armoured layout prefabs
- [1m Full Armour](/1m%20Full%20Armour) contains a set of 7x7 to 15x15 front and side armoured layout prefabs
- [APS Tetris Templates](APS%20Tetris%20Templates.blueprint) construct is a single construct containing all templates

## Usage
Copy the [1m](/1m), [1m Front Armour](/1m%20Front%20Armour) and [1m Full Armour](/1m%20Full%20Armour) directories into your FtD prefabs directory.  
Copy the [APS Tetris Templates](APS%20Tetris%20Templates.blueprint) blueprint into your constructs directory or subscribe to it on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3421456467) to keep it up to date automatically
