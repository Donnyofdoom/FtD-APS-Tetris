# FtD-APS-Tetris
Collection of community discovered highest density APS tetris layouts for 9x9 to 19x19 round turrets using 3 clip (T) loaders, intended to be used as prefabs.  
Non-trivial layouts were found computationally and are guaranteed to be the highest possible density (if not the most symmetric)  
Prefab layouts were chosen for their density, if you value symmetry over density a set of alternative symmetric layouts are in [Symmetric](/Symmetric) for layouts where the highest density was not also symmetric  

Prefabs come in three different flavours:
- No Armour: Maximum amount of loaders with no protection  
- Front Armour: One space left on only the leading edge, compromise between firepower and protection  
- Front and Side Armour: One space left on the leading edge and the sides, best protection with slightly reduced firepower  

[APS Tetris Templates](APS%20Tetris%20Templates.blueprint) construct is a single construct containing all 1m templates.  
Mostly useful for being able to subscribe via [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3421456467) as it's missing 2m-8m loader lengths and requires manually capturing your own prefabs but easier to keep up to date
